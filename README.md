## ‚ùì FAQ

### Why do you need a server if the app is client-side only?

The server component is **only used to fetch Steam data** due to browser CORS restrictions. Browsers block direct requests to Steam's API from web applications for security reasons. 

The server acts as a simple proxy that:
- Fetches public Steam profile information
- Retrieves game library data and prices
- Updates account statistics

**Your passwords and sensitive data NEVER go through the server.** All encryption/decryption happens locally in your browser. The server never sees or stores any of your credentials.

### Why is this hosted on a domain? Looks like a scam...

**This is a legitimate concern!** Here's why it's hosted online:

1. **Convenience & Cross-Platform Access** - You can access your accounts from any device (PC, phone, tablet) using any modern browser without installing anything.

2. **It's Just Static Files** - When you visit the website, you're downloading static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. After that, everything runs locally in your browser.

3. **Fully Autonomous** - Once loaded, the app works completely offline. You can disconnect from the internet and still access all your data.

4. **Transparent & Verifiable** - The code is open-source. You can review it yourself to verify that nothing suspicious is happening.

5. **Self-Hosting Option** - If you're still concerned (which is totally valid for security-sensitive apps), you can easily host it on your own server or even run it locally.

**Security Best Practices:**
- ‚úÖ Always verify the official repository URL
- ‚úÖ Check the code yourself (it's open-source)
- ‚úÖ Use self-hosting for maximum security
- ‚úÖ Enable two-factor authentication on your Google account if using Drive sync

### How does offline mode work?

The app is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that caches all necessary files locally. Once you've visited the site once, it works completely offline thanks to Service Workers.

### What happens if I forget my master password?

Unfortunately, **there's no way to recover your data** without the master password. This is by design for security. The encryption is genuine - even the developer cannot access your data without your password.

**Always remember your master password or store it securely!**

### Can I use this without Google Drive?

Yes! Google Drive integration is completely optional. You can:
- Use the app entirely offline with local storage
- Export encrypted backups manually to your computer
- Never connect to Google Drive at all
